# Word2Vec For Basket Analysis
The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of adopting a statistical NLP technique such as Word2vec for Basket Analysis. 
The ultimate aim is to come up with a "recommendation system" that suggests the best complements to be displayed alongside a selected query product. 
Since there are no objective parameters to evaluate the "goodness" of a potential suggestion, the number of co-purchases query-suggestion has been used to assess the ML model.
